I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	0
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.	0
It was absolutely amazing.	1
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
Highly recommended.	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
It was probably dirt.	0
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.	0

Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	1
Pretty good beer selection too.	1
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
Poor quality.	0
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  	0
Food was really boring.	0
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.	0

The noise shield is incrediable.	1
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0
The acting sucked.  	0
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	0
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..	1

There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0

Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1

I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.	0
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1
It is a joy to use.	1
great headset, very impressed - H500.	1
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.	1
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1

I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
It's AGGRAVATING!	0
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1

The story is beyond stupid.  	0
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  	0
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
It was so BORING!  	0

Lots of holes in the script.  	0

but it is great, i would really recommend it	1
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  	1
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  	0
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1

Omit watching this.  	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	0

The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
The pleather case doesn't fit.	0
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere.  	0
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1

Simple, lightweight and great fit.	1
Awesome service and food.	1
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
I love their fries and their beans.	1
Its the best headset I have used.	1
A great way to finish a great.	1
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0

It Was So Cool.  	1
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.	1
The script is bad, very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.	1
I could not recommend these more.	0
Excellent!.	1
The block was amazing.	1
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
I was seated immediately.	1
Works good.	1
The only downside is the service.	0
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
Good food , good service .	1
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
This is not movie-making.  	0
Thank you for such great service.	1
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
Battery has no life.	0
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1
What a mistake that was!	0
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
Awkward to use and unreliable.	0
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  	0
They were excellent.	1
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
Worst ever.	0
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
I have recommended it to friends.  	1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
I got it because it was so small and adorable.	1

Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	0
It was not good.	0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
I am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
I don't like this Nokia either.	0
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	1
!I definitly recommend!!	1
Pretty piece of junk.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
Worked great!.	1
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
I thought it was bad.  	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
It was awesome.	1
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	0
Gets the job done.	1
This is a good joint.	1
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
Food was so gooodd.	1
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
Better than expected.	1
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.	0
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
However I needed some better instructions.	0
Both great!	1
BT50 battery junk!.	0
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	1
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0
Its not user friendly.	0
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	1
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	0
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
first time there and might just be the last.	0
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	0
Food was delicious!	1
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	0
Really awful.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	1
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	1
Last time buying from you.	0
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	1
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
It definitely was not as good as my S11.	1
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
The ambiance was incredible.	1
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
Works as described.	1
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1
much better than the hard plastic cases.	1
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
Restored my phone to like new performance.	1
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
A good time!	1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  	1
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	0
camera color balance is AWFUL.	0
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.	0
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	0
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1

Item Does Not Match Picture.	0
None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
I highly recommend this device to everyone!	1
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
I gave it a 10  	1
The service was extremely slow.	0
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  	0
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.	1
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	1
They work about 2 weeks then break.	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Then the film just dropped the ball.  	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
I will not be eating there again.	0
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
Would not recommend to others.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
Love this product.	1
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	1
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
Really bad.  	0
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
Battery is terrible.	0
I won't be back.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	1
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1
Nice case, feels good in your hands.	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
$50 Down the drain.	0
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
The reception through this headset is excellent.	1
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
poor voice clarity.	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
The construction of the headsets is poor.	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
Does not fit.	0
This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  	0
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
I'll even say it again ¬ñ this is torture.  	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0

An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	1
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
In a word, it is embarrassing.  	0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0

This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1

Waste of 13 bucks.	0
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	1
I'm not eating here!	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
Soggy and not good.	0
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1

I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0
DELICIOUS!!	1
I've had better atmosphere.	0
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0

About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  	0
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.	1
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	0
Service was very prompt.	1
As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1

This place is disgusting!	0
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
And the sound quality is great.	1
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0
It is simple to use and I like it.	1
Excellent sound quality.	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1

The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	1
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1

The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0

I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  	1
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0
After two I felt disgusting.	0
I rate this movie 9/10.  	1

The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1

I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Qu√©bec.  	0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1

Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0

The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0

I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
Truly awful.	0

Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
It was delicious!!!	1
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1

We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
Very poor service.	0
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	0
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
I will be back many times soon.	1
Terrible management.	0

They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0

The commercials are the most misleading.	0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
No plot whatsoever!  	0
I had to purchase a different case.	0
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.	0
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
It was equally awful.	0
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0
Portable and it works.	1

Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  	1
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
This fixes all the problems.	1
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
I'm pleased.	1

One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
It really created a unique feeling though.  	1
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
All in all, a great disappointment.  	0
Very very fun chef.	1
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	0
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	0
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1
I did not expect this to be so good!	1
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	0
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
Great for the jawbone.	1

He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0

So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.	0
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1

This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  	0
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
I never walked out of a movie faster.  	0
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	1

O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.	1
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It is a true classic.  	1
Cant say enough good things about this place.	1
This battery is an excellent bargain!	1

The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
Very pleased with this headset.	1

It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1
Please dont waste your money.	0
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.	0
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.	1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0
Krussel Always good.	1
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.	1
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Worth every penny.	1
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0
There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1
I also didn't like the "on" button, it felt like it would crack with use.	0
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0
I don't think you will be disappointed.  	1
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	0
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.	0
10 out of 10 stars.  	1
He's a national treasure.  	1
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.	0
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
That was nice.  	1
Service was good and the company was better!	1
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.	1
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	1
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1
Good show, Samsung.	1
So absolutley fantastic.	1
The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  	1
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
And service was super friendly.	1
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
Service was fantastic.	1
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	0
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	0
I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.	1
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
I would not recommend this place.	0
Better than you'd expect.	1
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0
One of the worst shows of all time.  	0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
Very good lunch spot.	1
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	1
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
And it was way to expensive.	0
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	0
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1
It is not good.  	0
Great product for the price!.	1
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
I was not impressed by this product.	0
The shipping time was also very quick!	1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
It's not what it says it is.	0
I especially love the long battery life.	1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
The script is¬Öwas there a script?  	0
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	0
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1
We won't be going back.	0
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
You wont regret it!  	1
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
Reversible plug works great.	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
We won't be returning.	0
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	1
I'm very disappointed with my decision.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	0
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Would recommend this item.	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
I would highly recommend this product.	1
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.	0
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	0
Perfect for the PS3.	1
Brilliant!  	1
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	1
I consider this theft.	0
Same problem as others have mentioned.	0
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	0
We will not be coming back.	0
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  	1
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.	0
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  	1
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Bad Quality.	0
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
This movie is BAD.  	0
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
W810i is just SUPERB.	1
this place is good.	1
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
The story line is just awful!  	0
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	1
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  	0
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0
Great software for Motorolas.	1
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	0
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	0
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	1
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
GO AND SEE IT!  	1
This movie is so awesome!  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	0
Totally believable.  	1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	1
I advise you to look out for it.  	1
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	0
doesn't last long.	0
This is just a great movie.  	1
Sooooo good!!	1
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	0
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
Having trouble with volume.	0
And none of the tones is acceptable.	0
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
The waitresses are very friendly.	1
Phone falls out easily.	0
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	0
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	1
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.	0
Really good product.	1
The result is a film that just don't look right.  	0
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	0
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  	0
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
Plug was the wrong size.	0
Just does not work.	0
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
Very bad Experience!	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
I liked this movie way too much.  	1
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	0
nice leather.	1
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
Looks great and is strong."	1
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	0
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	0
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	1
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
If you want a real scare rent this one!  	1
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	1
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
There was hardly any meat.	0
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
there is no real plot.  	0
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  	0
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  	0
That was done in the second movie.  	0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
Everything was gross.	0
Love the margaritas, too!	1
It was pretty gross!	0
Great Pizza and Salads!	1
is pretty funny.  	1
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
I just wanted to leave.	0
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0
An absolute must visit!	1
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).	0
Great phone!.	1
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
Even worse than Ticker!  	0
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Was not happy.	0
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  	0
Very wind-resistant.	1
The story line is totally predictable.  	0
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	0
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	1
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
The service was meh.	0
Incredible!.	1
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
Not easy to watch.  	0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
Sprint - terrible customer service.	0
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	1
For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	0
Will go back next trip out.	1
Battery lasts only a few hours.	0
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1
Excellent product.	1
I never come again.	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0
And then tragedy struck.	0
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
Pretty cool I would say.	1
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	0
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
I rather enjoyed it.  	1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
Good value, great food, great service.	1
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.	0
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.	0
Simply beautiful.  	1
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	1
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1
This place is amazing!	1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.	1
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.	1
REALLY UGLY.	0
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	0
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	0
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
The fries were great too.	1
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
I love this thing!	1
The best phone in market :).	1
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	1
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.	1
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	1
Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	1
Battery life is real good.	1
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
Very disappointing.  	0
Eclectic selection.	1
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	1
But then they came back cold.	0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  	0
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	0
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
worthless product.	0
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	0
Don't waste your time here.	0
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
Disappointed!.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
Don't waste your money!.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	0
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.	0
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.	1
It is a really good show to watch.  	1

I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  	0
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	1

The replacement died in a few weeks.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
Works for me.	1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
Service stinks here!	0

Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	0
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.	1
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	1

About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0

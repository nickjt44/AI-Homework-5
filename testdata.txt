Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	0
Good price.	1
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.	0
Doesn't hold charge.	0
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	0
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
Wasted two hours.  	0
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
I'm still infatuated with this phone.	1
Great movie!  	1
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
It's a great item.	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
Everything about it is just bad.  	0
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.	0
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	1
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
Great Earpiece.	1
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
The staff was very attentive.	1
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
Very good, though!	1
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
I've never been treated so bad.	0
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	0
Very good quality though	1
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.	0
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	1
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
)Setup couldn't have been simpler.	1
Not impressed.	0
Don't bother coming here.	0
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
Great case and price!	1
I'm super pissd.	0
Better Than New.	1
I'd like to return it.	0
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
Food arrived quickly!	1
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	0
Now I know that I made a wise decision.	1
Bad Choice.	0
Talk about USELESS customer service.	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
I am glad I purchased it.	1
dont go here.	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
A great touch.	1
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	1
Everyone is treated equally special.	1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
The plug did not work very well.	0
Works great.	1
Those burgers were amazing.	1
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
Great audio!.	1
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
The management is rude.	0
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Avoid at all costs.  	0
Over rated.	0
Nice solid keyboard.	1
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0
I highly recommend this case.	1
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	0
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  	0
This place has it!	1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
Great for iPODs too.	1
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
Setup went very smoothly.	1
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.	0
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	0
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	0
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	0
Great Hands Free Device.	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.	0
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	1
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
Crust is not good.	0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	0
The cast is good.  	1
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
Disappointed with battery.	0
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.	0
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	1
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
No buyers remorse on this one!.	0
You won't be disappointed.	1
Even the squibs look awful.  	0
The directing seems too pretentious.  	0
A bit predictable.  	0
I cannot make calls at certain places.	0
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
Great for using with your home stereo.	1
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!	1
It didn't charge for me.	0
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
The lighting is awful.  	0
Lasted one day and then blew up.	0
This is high adventure at its best.  	1
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	1
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	1
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	1
The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  	1
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	0
Wow... Loved this place.	1
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
I received it quickly and it works great!!	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.	0
Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0
Great price, too!	1
Battery life is also great!	1
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
Doesn't do the job.	0
Very, very sad.	0
You can't beat the price on these.	1
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
fast service.	1
For the price this was a great deal.	1
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  	0
This is a great deal.	1
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	0
Could not get strong enough signal.	0
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
It is shameful.  	0
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1
10/10  	1
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
Great bluetooth!.	1
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.	1
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.	1
the phone was unusable and was not new.	0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
Her role was played well.  	1
This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
But this movie really got to me.  	1
Excellent Phone.	1
Good transmit audio.	1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
stay away from this store, be careful.	0
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.	0
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0
Excellent wallet type phone case.	1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  	0
So far it has worked like a charm.	1
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
I really liked that.  	1
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
I was so insulted.	0
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  	0
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1
Works fine.	1
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1
All three broke within two months of use.	0
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	0
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1
The reception has been generally good.	1
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	0
I won't be back.	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
See it.  	1
Love this headset!	1
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.	0
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	0
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
Good product - incredible value.	1
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	0
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
Definitely a bargain.	1
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
So just beware.	0
The design is very good.4.	1
Nice docking station for home or work.	1
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.	0
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
The least said about the acting the better.  	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
Service sucks.	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!	1
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.	1
It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	1
You won't regret it!	1
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
I love this bluetooth!	1
The selection of food was not the best.	0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	0
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
We loved the place.	1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1
Comfortable in my hand.	1
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
Great pork sandwich.	1
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.	1
Go rent it.  	1
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0
Its a total package.	1
Also great directing and photography.  	1
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	1
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  	1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
My headset works just peachy-keen.	1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
Returned 8 hours later.	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
So they performed.	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
2 Thumbs Up!!	1
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	0
How awful she is!  	0
(It works!)	1
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1
Very much disappointed with this company.	0
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	1
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	1
I would have given no star if I was able.	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0

Great product.	1
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  	0

My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
How awesome is that.	1
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0

But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.	0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
What a waste.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1

High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
VERY comfortable.	1
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.	0
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1

I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  	1
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  	0
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.	1

My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	1
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0
I bought two of them and neither will charge.	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0

The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	1
A pretty good product.	1
Bad Purchase.	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0

1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1

TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	1

But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  	1
Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.	1
